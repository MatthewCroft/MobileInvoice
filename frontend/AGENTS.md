# Frontend Development Guidelines

This document defines conventions for all code in this `frontend` directory.

## UI Components

- Use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) components for building the interface.
- All styling should be implemented with Tailwind CSS.

## Mobile First

- Design every page and component with a mobile-first approach.
- Ensure layouts are responsive, scaling up for larger screens as needed.

## Testing
- do not write tests


## Backend Integration

- When calling backend APIs, reference the documentation and implementations in the `backend` directory to understand available endpoints and payloads.
